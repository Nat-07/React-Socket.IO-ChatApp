### Deployment &nbsp; :package:

The active [example](https://instant-chatapp-react-socketio.herokuapp.com/) is deployed using [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).For more information visit their [documentation](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/deployment) to learn how to deploy

**Note:** Varying approaches could be taken. Ie, deploying the front end and back end individually + using CORS. The active [example](https://instant-chatapp-react-socketio.herokuapp.com/) dishes the built html as well as socketio server.
